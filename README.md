# Automated Git Commit Logger  

## Overview  
This project is a **C# Service Console Application** that automatically updates this README file with a hydrated commit history. The goal is to **simulate an active commit history**, demonstrating a well-maintained project while encouraging recruiters to engage in one-on-one conversations about personal projects.  

## Features  
- **Automated README Updates** – The service app appends timestamps to track commit history.  
- **Simulated Git Activity** – Regular commits and pushes make the repository look actively developed.  
- **Encourages Direct Engagement** – Aims to shift focus from commit quantity to meaningful discussions.  

## How It Works  
1. The service console application runs on a scheduled interval.  
2. It updates this README with a new timestamp to reflect ongoing activity.  
3. A git commit is made and pushed automatically.  

## Latest Update  
_Last updated on: **(Auto-updated timestamp here)**_  

## Why This Project?  
Recruiters often judge candidates by commit frequency without understanding project depth. This tool highlights **meaningful conversations over raw commit count**.  

## Setup & Usage  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Configure your **Git credentials** in `git_credentials.json`.  
3. Run the C# console app to start auto-committing.
