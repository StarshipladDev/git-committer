# Git-Committer -> Automated Git Commit Logger  

![Once Useful Image Available, it will be dispalyed here]()

This project is a **C# Service Console Application** that automatically updates this README file with a hydrated commit history. The goal is to **simulate an active commit history**, demonstrating a well-maintained project while encouraging recruiters to engage in one-on-one conversations about personal projects.  

## Notes/Know Bugs:

> *Important* Only updates are regex-matched timestamps, without these the update will not run and is not handled cleanly. No Ticket Yet

> Bug that is blocker for new features or other fix


## Features(Planned In Brackets)

- **Automated README Updates**  The service app appends timestamps to track commit history.  
- **Simulated Git Activity**  Regular commits and pushes make the repository look actively developed.  
- **Encourages Direct Engagement**  Aims to shift focus from commit quantity to meaningful discussions.

> Prompt engineering with Open AI 

## Setup & Usage  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Configure your **Git credentials** in `gitconfig.json`.  
3. Run the C# console app to start auto-committing.
